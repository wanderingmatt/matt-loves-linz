    <h3>The Stories</h3>
    <div class="grid_7 suffix_1 story">
      <h4>How I Met My Honey Bunny</h4>
      <h4><em>by Lindsey</em></h4>
      <h5>Handsome, tall, blue-eyed Matt</h5>
      <p>It all began when I met Deb Hunter while working at Starbucks in Burnsville, MN. We soon found that we had a few things in common and she invited me for brunch with her and her "boys".</p>
      <p>Upon arriving on that fateful morning, I was introduced to four handsome men. I spent the afternoon with them and when I got up to leave, one of them (Matt) invited me over for his birthday party. I couldn't make it because I was in the process of sending my current boyfriend back to Seattle for good.</p>
      <p>Fast forward one week later, the old ball and chain took a bus back to where he had come from and I was a free woman. Lo and behold handsome, tall, blue eyed Matt had come to visit "his mom" at work. I asked him about some music I'd heard at brunch and he lent me the CDs. Of which he never officially got back. <strong>I asked</strong> if he'd like to do something sometime and got his number. I then bit my nails as I waited for the obligatory three days to pass before making the call.</p>
      <p>I, proudly, made it 2. We set up a date to hang out. That first date lasted 12 awesome hours and the rest, the say, is history. I love you Matty!</p>

      <h4>How I Met My Binzerbubs</h4>
      <h4><em>by Matt</em></h4>
      <h5>The Hot Girl with the Long Hair</h5>
      <p>In Minnesota, I used to eat dinner at my Mum's place nearly every Sunday. One Sunday in particular, I stopped in at the Starbucks where I used to work before arriving at my Mum's.</p>
      <p>There was a new girl working there. I don't think she noticed me - lucky for me, I was staring pretty hard at her while one of her co-workers rang me up. She was absolutely gorgeous. She had long, beautiful hair that ran all the way down to her butt. I couldn't remember the last time I saw hair that long. Her profile was striking, her eyes were green and she looked honest and delicate. In other words, she was <strong>way</strong> out of my league.</p>
      <p>When I got to my Mum's, I told my brother Lucas about the mysterious new Starbucks girl. I recommended that he keep his eye out for her the next time he went for coffee. As Mum called us for dinner, I remember Lucas asking me,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"How will I know which one she is?"</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I quickly replied,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"It won't be that hard, dude - <br />she's the hot one with the long hair!"</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h5>Sunday Brunch</h5>
      <p>The following Saturday, my Mum called to inform me that she was doing a brunch in place of our typical Sunday dinner. I love breakfast food; however, was working nights at the time. I didn't exactly fancy the idea of getting up early and making the 45 minute drive down to Burnsville. My Mum convinced me by saying she would be inviting a <strong>friend</strong> from work. Naturally, I assumed that her <strong>friend</strong> was a woman of at least 35 with similar interests. Boy, was I wrong!</p>
      <p>The next day I get up later than I should, skip showering, throw on an old, torn sweater and don't bother with my incredibly messy, long hair. After all, it isn't like I was going to need to impress anyone...right?</p>
      <p>I show up (late) to brunch and walk in the front door only to find that the <strong>friend</strong> my Mum had invited was actually the hot girl with the long hair. Her name was Lindsey.</p>
      <p>What followed was quite possibly the greatest social recovery I'll probably ever make. I was incredibly embarrassed and dreadfully shy after walking through the door. I managed to sit across from her at the table but squandered most of my talking opportunities. All I could think to talk about was computers and video games. I did manage to make her laugh often though and, somehow by the end of brunch I had built up enough confidence. I asked her to come watch a movie at my apartment that night with some friends of mine. Much to my dismay, she said she couldn't make it. I left that night, not knowing if I would ever see her again.</p>
      <h5>Working at the Bank Finally Pays Off</h5>
      <p>The following Friday, I was back in Burnsville spending some time with my Mum on my birthday. We stopped in at Starbucks so she could pick up her pay cheque. In the lobby, there was Lindsey, talking candidly about how she hated going to the bank across the street to get her cheques cashed. I overheard that the employees at that particular branch always gave her a hard time. Being that I used to work there and knew all of the employees personally, I was certain I would be able to help Lindsey out. I offered to drive her across the street and talk with the Manager. It worked. They cashed Lindsey's cheque without any questions. I had her there and back within 5 minutes.</p>
      <p>When we got back to Starbucks, Lindsey asked me what CD had been playing in my car. I told her it was Paul Oakenfold. She thanked me, smiled and then we said goodbye. I walked out with my Mum, but was determined to make sure I would see Lindsey again. So, before leaving, I grabbed the CD out of my car and ran back in to Starbucks. I asked another employee for a pen and tore off a piece of receipt paper from the register. On the piece of paper, I wrote down a list of similar artists I thought Linz might enjoy. More importantly, at the bottom, I wrote down my phone number. I tucked the paper inside the CD case and walked to the side of the pastry case where Lindsey was standing. I handed her the CD and told her she could borrow it. Linz looked hesitant and said,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"I can't just take this - <br />how will I get it back to you?"</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Thinking quickly on my feet again, I replied,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Don't worry. I'm sure we'll see each other again soon."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Then, nervously (because I didn't want her to see that I had left my phone number inside the case) I booked it.</p>
      <h5>2 Days is a Long Time</h5>
      <p>Two days later, Linz called me at work. She informed me that she would be in Minneapolis, donating blood the following Saturday and wondered if I'd like to have lunch with her. I didn't care that I was working nights, all I could think was,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Wow! She's giving blood - <br />could this girl get any hotter?"</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I agreed, of course, and the date was set. <strong>Linz</strong> did indeed call to setup our first date; however, contrary to popular belief, <strong>I gave</strong> her my phone number!</p>
      <h5>If Anything Can Go Wrong, It Will?<em>*</em></h5>
      <p><em class="caveat">* This section has been removed due to extreme embarrassment! You'll have to ask about it at the wedding.</em></p>
      <h5>6 Years in the Making</h5>
      <p>Here I am, six years later. Still, hopelessly in love with that hot girl with the long<em>*</em> hair. <em class="caveat">* Hair not quite as long</em></p>
      <p>I can't believe how the last 6 years have gone by so fast and so slow at the same time. Every day, I am inspired by Lindsey's unique way of thinking and in debt to her endless support of my happiness and my career. Thanks to Lindsey, I am less sarcastic and less cynical; more patient and more excited. I'm also far more goofy.</p>
      <p>I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with you, Linz. <br /><strong>I'm yours!</strong></p>
